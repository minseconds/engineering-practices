# Engineering Practices & Style Guides

Every organization and open-source project has its own best practices and style guides about how to design a project and
write code for that project. It is easier to understand a large codebase if it follows a consistent design and style.

This project contains the engineering practices & style guides that we follow in our projects here at Forus Labs. It
contains a broad spectrum of documents and guides ranging from how we use Git to our style guide for Flutter.

It is important to understand that whatever that is highlighted in the guides are not hard-and-fast rules; that it is
perfectly reasonable to diverge from the guides if the situation warrants.
